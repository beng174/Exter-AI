# Current handoff

Priority: stable low-cost kernel. Use npm run kernel:next and one listed task.

- Baseline before K04: 1ce9f2b. K03 CI passed all jobs, including Python scenes.
- K04 audio code is implemented behind EXTER_KERNEL_AUDIO_ENABLED, default off.
  CPU int8 faster-whisper and local YAMNet SavedModel adapters require a verified
  offline pack; no weights/providers are downloaded/called at startup or by reads.
- Speech, music-lyric candidates and ambiguous words stay separate. Licensing is
  null; no audio-only claim of on-camera vs voiceover. Thresholds are uncalibrated.
- Fixtures test policy/PCM plumbing only, not actual model accuracy. K04 remains
  blocked until a reviewed model pack, labelled audio evaluation and real worker
  peak-memory benchmark pass. Do not mark those gates complete from fixtures.
- Independent next task: K05 OCR and visual presence. K06 still depends on K04/K05.
- Full model requirements and provenance contract: worker/AUDIO-MODELS.md.
- K01-LIVE/K02-LIVE/K03-LIVE remain blocked; API keys, live broker configuration,
  worker image/capacity and combined source/feature cache checks remain pending.
- Keep scene/audio/full-label stages disabled for normal Render deployment.
  No new paid inference or hosted model run took place for this change.
- Full revised product document/genuine Meta recordings were not supplied.
- Paused scoring/export draft remains local wip/winning-workflow-before-kernel.
